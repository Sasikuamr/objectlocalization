# objectlocalization
This project focuses on solving the Object Localization problem using deep learning techniques. Unlike traditional object detection, which only identifies what is in an image, object localization also determines where the object is by predicting its bounding box coordinates.

The goal is to train a neural network that can accurately identify and localize a specific object in an image by drawing a bounding box around it.
